# Benchmarks
This is mainly done as a test, but to see if i can code the exact same thing across a couple languages.

C# and C++ Perform about the same, with the last test being around 22seconds. Java and Node are Around 24 seconds

PHP took about 2 minutes, python took about 17 minutes for some reason... and LUA just straight up crashed, but looked like it was going to be worse than python
